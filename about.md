I'm Kamil, I'm working as a Python Backend Engineer, currently on a Polish-based company [Tooploox](https://www.tooploox.com/)
(...and we're recruiting for many positions, let's join us!). 

I have some background in networking services, but now I'm focused on backend and cloud engineering. In free time, sometimes
I create a software I love to share on my GitHub.
